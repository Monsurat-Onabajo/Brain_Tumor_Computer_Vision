# Brain Tumor Detection using EfficientNetB2

## Project Overview
The ""Brain Tumor Computer Vision" project aimed to develop an accurate and efficient computer vision solution for detecting brain tumors in medical images. By leveraging the power of EfficientNetB2, a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architecture, along with transfer learning techniques, this project provided accurate diagnoses and assisted medical professionals in identifying potential brain tumors.

## Key Objectives
- Implemented a deep learning model for brain tumor detection using the EfficientNetB2 architecture.
- Utilized transfer learning to leverage pre-trained weights and adapt the model to medical image data.
- Trained the model on a well-curated dataset of brain MRI scans, achieving high accuracy.
- Developed an intuitive user interface for uploading MRI scans and obtaining predictions.
- Deployed the trained model using Hugging Face's space for seamless sharing and accessibility.

## Project Highlights
- **EfficientNetB2 Model:** EfficientNetB2 which is known for its efficiency and effectiveness in image classification tasks was used for this project.
- **Transfer Learning:** Transfer learning accelerated model training by starting from pre-trained weights, allowing the model to learn specific features relevant to brain tumor detection without extensive data.
- **Dataset:** A carefully curated dataset of brain MRI scans which was gotten from kaggle was used to train and validate the model in order to ensure its ability to generalize to real-world cases.
- **User Interface:** The project featured an intuitive user interface that enabled users to upload MRI scans, submit them for analysis, and receive predictions.
- **Deployment:** Hugging Face's space was used for deploying the trained model, making it accessible for medical professionals and researchers.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** The primary programming language for model development and interface creation.
- **PyTorch:** Utilized for building and training the EfficientNetB2-based model.
- **Transfer Learning:** Leveraged for adapting the pre-trained EfficientNetB2 to brain MRI data.
- **Hugging Face Space:** Used for deploying and sharing the trained model.
- **User Interface Framework:** A user-friendly interface was developed using a suitable framework (e.g., Flask, Django, or a web-based GUI library).

## Future Scope
- The project laid the groundwork for further enhancements, such as multi-class classification for different tumor types, interpretability of model decisions, and integration with medical systems.
- A user-friendly interface will be developed using a suitable framework (e.g., Flask, Django, or a web-based GUI library).
